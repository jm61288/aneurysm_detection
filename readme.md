How to Execute the Matlab Code
------------------------------

- The **MAIN** file to be executed : [matlab_code/main.m](https://github.com/jm61288/aneurysm_detection/blob/master/matlab_code/main.m)
 
- To note the performance of the auto_threshold algorithm against other thresholding algorithms :
 --  Execute  [matlab_code/thresh_comparison.m](https://github.com/jm61288/aneurysm_detection/blob/master/matlab_code/thresh_comparison.m)
 -- After execution check folder **htmlT** for the thresholded images
 
- To generate figure plot of thresholded value chosen:
 -- Exceute [matlab_code/createfigure_plot.m](https://github.com/jm61288/aneurysm_detection/blob/master/matlab_code/createfigure_plot.m)
